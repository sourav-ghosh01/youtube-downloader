# Youtube-Downloader

The YouTube video downloader project is a software application designed to enable users to download videos from YouTube for offline viewing. The primary objective is to provide a user-friendly tool where individuals can input the URL of a desired video and choose options such as video quality (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p) and file formats (like MP4 or MP3). The application typically features a progress indicator to show download status, and it may support batch downloads for multiple URLs at once.
